# Better-TSC-NJT-Revamp
A better version of the NJT Revamp for TSC with better scenery and stop markers




!IMPORTANT! Most of this mod was made by the original creators or NJT Revamp I am only adding to it to make it more realistic.



At the moment I am working on the Gladstone Line and other lines will be completed

There are not trees and scenerybeetwen long gaps of stations like far hills and bernerdsville-sceneryt continunues once you arrive at the station
